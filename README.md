# Loops

I made a program that asks the user for 10 numbers (using loops) and then finds the average of the numbers that the user added.

I also made it so if the number that the user added is below zero it can't go through telling the user "You can't put a number below  0 .Try again." . 

Feel free to use my code and make some changes.
